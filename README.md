# React Interview Questions & Answers

## üöÄIntroduction

### What is React? What is the Role of React in software development?

React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is created and maintained by Facebook and was released in 2013.

- A ReactJS application is made with multiple components, each component responsible for outputting a small, reusable piece of HTML code. So components are the heart of all React applications.
- React is also famous for building single-page applications and mobile apps.

### What are the key Features of React?

There are several features available on React because it is widely popular.

- **JSX:** JSX is a JavaScript syntax extension. It is faster than normal JavaScript as it performs optimizations while translating to regular JavaScript. By using that, we can write HTML structures in the same file that contains JavaScript code.
- **Virtual DOM:** Virtual DOM is nothing, but a lightweight copy of the Real DOM. Manipulating Real DOM is much slower compared to Virtual DOM, so it's used to improve the performance, update the real DOM, reducing the amount of direct manipulation.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow (One-way Data Binding):** ReactJS follows a unidirectional data flow, also known as one-way data binding. The data is transferred from top to bottom i.e. from parent components to child components. This helps in maintaining a clear and predictable flow of data.
- **Component Based Architecture:** A Component is one of the core building blocks of React. React follows a component-based architecture, where the UI is broken down into reusable and modular components. Each component depends on its own logic, state, and view that making it easier to manage and maintain the code.
- **Performance:** ReactJS is a high-performance library for creating user interfaces. This feature makes it much better than other frameworks. The reason behind, it manages a virtual DOM & use JSX which is faster compared to normal JavaScript and HTML.
- **Simplicity:** ReactJS uses JSX file which makes the application simple and to code as well as understand. We know that ReactJS is a component-based approach which makes the code reusable as your need.
- **Debugging:** React applications are straightforward and easy to test. Even Facebook provides a small browser extension that makes React debugging easier and faster.

### What are the Advantage of React or why we use React?

There are various reasons why you should choose ReactJS as a primary tool for building application.

- Simple to build Single Page Application
- React is cross platform (web & mobile) and open source (free to use)
- Light weight and very fast
- Easy to Learn and Use
- Creating Dynamic web applications becomes easier
- Reusable Components
- Making scalable apps where you may need to frequently add new features
- Better code stability
- Strong community support

### What are the Disadvantage of React?

There are some disadvantage of react like:

- React is not good choice for very small application
- Poor documention is big problem for new developers
- Its just a library for building UI components so complete the react application we need addition tools or libraries like routing, state management so on.
- React support single page application so its face challenges for **SEO** friendly application.

### What is DOM? What is difference between HTML and DOM?

DOM stands for Document Object Model. DOM is the actual tree-like structure of a web page, which is is dynamically generated by the browser when a web page is loaded.

- DOM allows JavaScript to interact and manipulate with the content, structure, and style of a document.
- HTML is a markup language used for creating the static structure of web pages.

### What is Virtual DOM?

Virtual DOM is nothing, but a lightweight copy of the Real DOM. Manipulating Real DOM is much slower compared to Virtual DOM, so it's used to improve the performance, update the real DOM, reducing the amount of direct manipulation.

### Difference between Virtual DOM and Real DOM?

Virtual DOM is nothing, but a lightweight copy of the Real DOM. Manipulating Real DOM is much slower compared to Virtual DOM, so it's used to improve the performance, update the real DOM, reducing the amount of direct manipulation.

Real DOM is the actual tree-like structure of a web page, which can be manipulated directly to change the layout or content of the page.

### How does Virtual DOM work?

When a component's state or props change, React will create a new virtual DOM tree, compare it to the previous tree, and then apply only the minimal set of changes necessary to the actual DOM. This improves the performance of the application and reduces the number of unnecessary re-renders.

### What is the difference between Shadow DOM and Virtual DOM?

The **Shadow DOM** is a browser technology designed to encapsulate the implementation of a component and keep it separate from the rest of the document.

The **Virtual DOM** is a concept used by libraries like React to optimize the process of updating the actual DOM for performance gains.

### What is Single Page Application (SPA)?

A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that have only one single page.

Whenever user do some action on the website, then in response content is dynamically updated without refreshing or loading a new page.

### What is the difference between Declarative & Imperative syntax?

- Declarative syntax focuses on **describing the desired result** without specifying the **step-by-step process** while imperative syntax involves step by step process to achive a paticular goal.

- **JSX** in React is used to write declarative syntax while **JavaScript** has an imperative syntax.

```javascript
// Declarative component in React
function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hello Dev!</h1>;
}

// Imperative component in React
function Greeting() {
  const element = document.createElement("h1");
  element.textContext = "Hello Dev!";
  document.body.appendChild(element);
}
```

### What are the Main Files in a React project?

### How React App Load and Display the components in browser?

### What are the difference between React and Angular?

### Why use React instead of other frameworks, like Angular?

React is a JavaScript library, whereas Angular is a front-end framework.

- React uses one-way data binding and virtual DOM, whereas Angular uses two-way data binding and real DOM.
- React is faster than Angular as it has a smaller bundle size.
- React is developed by Facebook, whereas Angular is developed by Google.

## ‚ö°JSX

### What is JSX?

JSX is a JavaScript XML syntax extension used with React to write UI components. It is faster than normal JavaScript as it performs optimizations while translating to regular JavaScript.

### What is the role of JSX in React?

By using JSX, we can write HTML structures in the same file that contains JavaScript code. Its converted into javascript via tool like Babel. Beacuse Browser understand javascript not JSX.

### What are the Advantage of JSX?

- JSX makes it easier to write or add HTML in React.
- JSX can easily convert HTML tags to react elements.
- JSX is faster than regular JavaScript because it performs optimization while translating the code to JavaScript.
- JSX is type-safe, and most of the errors can be found at compilation time.

### What are the Disadvantage of JSX?

- JSX throws an error if the HTML is not correct.
- In JSX HTML code must be wrapped in one top-level element otherwise it will give an error.
- If HTML elements are not properly closed JSX will give an error.

### What is Arrow Function Expression in JSX?

In JavaScript and JSX, an arrow function expression is a concise way to define a function.

### What is Babel?

Babel is a JavaScript transpiler that converts **Modern JavaScript** into plain old ES5 JavaScript that code can run in older browser.

### What is the role of Fragment in JSX?

React **Fragments** allow you to group multiple elements without adding an extra node to the DOM.

- This can be useful when rendering multiple child elements or components in a single parent component.
- Fragments are represented by an empty JSX tag `<>...</>` or `<React.Fragment>...</React.Fragment>`. You can also use key prop with `<React.Fragment>`.

### Why are Fragments better than container div?

**Fragments** are better than container divs because they don't add an extra node to the DOM.

- We can write cleaner, more readable code with React Fragments.
- It takes up less memory and renders components faster. Each component is rendered as expected.
